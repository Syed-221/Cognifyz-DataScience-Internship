- Descriptive & Visual Analysis
- Geospatial Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Price Range & Online Delivery Analysis
- Predictive Modeling

## Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn

## Folder Structure
- Task1_TableBooking_OnlineDelivery.ipynb
- Task2_PriceRange_Analysis.ipynb
- Task3_DataExploration_Preprocessing.ipynb
- Dataset.csv

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab or Jupyter Lab.
3. Install required libraries: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn`
4. Run the notebooks sequentially.
